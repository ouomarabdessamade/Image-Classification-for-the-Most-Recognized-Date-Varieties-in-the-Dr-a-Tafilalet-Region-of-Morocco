# Image Classification for the Most Recognized Date Varieties in the DrÃ¢a-Tafilalet Region of Morocco

## Project Overview
ðŸŒ´ Welcome to our Image Classification Project! ðŸŒ´

In this exciting venture, we delve into the world of Computer Vision to classify the most recognized date varieties in the DrÃ¢a-Tafilalet Region of Morocco using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

### Image Classification
Witness the magic of CNN as we harness its power to distinguish between different types of date varieties. The visual richness captured in our images is a testament to the unique characteristics of each date type.

### Model Architecture
Our chosen path to success involves the use of a sequential architecture, carefully designed to unravel the intricacies of date variety classification.

### Data Augmentation with DCGAN
To further enhance the robustness of our model, we employ Data Augmentation techniques using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN). The augmented dataset not only boosts model performance but also introduces diversity for a more comprehensive learning experience.
